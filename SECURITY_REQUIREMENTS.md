## üõ°Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Code-Level Enforcement

#### 1.1 Method Signatures
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - User ID required
def create_time_entry(self, project_id: int, task_id: int, spent_date: date, 
                     hours: float, notes: str = '', user_id: int = None):

# ‚ùå INCORRECT - No user context
def create_time_entry(self, project_id: int, task_id: int, spent_date: date, hours: float):
```

#### 1.2 Security Checks
```python
# ‚úÖ REQUIRED - Security validation
if user_id is None:
    raise ValueError("SECURITY VIOLATION: user_id is required")

credentials = self._get_credentials(user_id)
if not credentials:
    raise ValueError(f"SECURITY VIOLATION: No valid credentials for user_id {user_id}")
```

#### 1.3 Audit Logging
```python
# ‚úÖ REQUIRED - Audit logging
print(f"üîç AUDIT: Creating timesheet entry for user_id {user_id}")
print(f"‚úÖ AUDIT: Successfully created time entry ID {entry_id} for user_id {user_id}")
```

### 2. Database-Level Enforcement

#### 2.1 Query Patterns
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - User-filtered query
ProjectMapping.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id, is_active=True).all()

# ‚ùå INCORRECT - No user filtering
ProjectMapping.query.filter_by(is_active=True).all()
```

#### 2.2 Foreign Key Constraints
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED:** All user data tables must have user_id foreign key
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED:** Database constraints must enforce user isolation
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED:** No orphaned data without user association

### 3. API-Level Enforcement

#### 3.1 Authentication Decorators
```python
# ‚úÖ REQUIRED - Authentication required
@app.route('/api/harvest/projects')
@login_required
def harvest_projects():
    user = get_current_user()
    # ... user-specific logic
```

#### 3.2 User Context Validation
```python
# ‚úÖ REQUIRED - User context validation
user = get_current_user()
if not user:
    return jsonify({'error': 'Authentication required'}), 401
```

---

## üö® PROHIBITED PATTERNS

### 1. Database Anti-Patterns
```python
# ‚ùå PROHIBITED - Gets any user's data
UserConfig.query.first()

# ‚ùå PROHIBITED - No user filtering
ProjectMapping.query.filter_by(is_active=True).all()

# ‚ùå PROHIBITED - Cross-user access
ProcessingHistory.query.all()
```

### 2. Service Anti-Patterns
```python
# ‚ùå PROHIBITED - No user context
def get_projects():
    # Missing user context

# ‚ùå PROHIBITED - Shared credentials
def create_entry_with_shared_creds():
    # Using shared or first user's credentials
```

### 3. API Anti-Patterns
```python
# ‚ùå PROHIBITED - No authentication
@app.route('/api/sensitive-data')
def sensitive_data():
    # Missing @login_required

# ‚ùå PROHIBITED - No user validation
def process_data():
    # Missing user context validation
```
