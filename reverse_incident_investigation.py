Subject: URGENT - Need to Check Your Harvest Timesheet (June 16 - July 13)

Hi [Colleague Name],

We discovered a critical bug in the Calendar-Harvest integration app that affected timesheet data between June 16 - July 13, 2025.

ISSUE: MY calendar events may have been processed and added to YOUR Harvest timesheet instead of mine.

IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:
1. Please check your Harvest timesheet for June 16 - July 13, 2025
2. Look for any entries that seem unfamiliar or don't match your actual work
3. Specifically look for:
   - Meetings you didn't attend
   - Projects you don't work on
   - Time entries that match MY work activities
   - Any entries with notes that reference my work

4. If possible, please export your timesheet for this period and send it to me

This is urgent as it affects billing accuracy and payroll. The bug has been fixed, but we need to correct the historical data.

Thanks for your help!

Best regards,
Josef
